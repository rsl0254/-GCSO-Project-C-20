# -GCSO-Project-C-20
In this programming project, I was able to use an algorithm that allowed me to detect collision and with that knowledge test car safety and reliability in the event of a car crash. First, I had set the velocity and speed at random numbers and based upon the deformation range after calculation, I used an if() condition to change the shapeColor of the vehicle. Also, once the car was in contact with the wall, I set the velocity =0 and change color as already mentioned.
